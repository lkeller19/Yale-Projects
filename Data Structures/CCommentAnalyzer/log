9/16   8:00pm  2:00  read assignment and looked at Piazza for hints
                     made an unsuccessful stab at the code
9/17   7:00am  3:30  researched about getchar, freopen, etc.
                     began implementing the giant state machine  
9/17   5:00pm  3:00  slowly built up the state machine based on failed test cases
9/18   4:00pm  5:00  finally passed all basic cases
                     amazingly implemented tags correctly at beginning but had type

I discussed my solution with: a very nice ULA whose name I don't remember

I'm not exactly sure why but this was the most frustration and bug free coding experience
that I've ever had. The people's questions on Piazza were extremely helpful in figuring out 
the form of the code. Professor Glenn mentioned getchar and putchar and that the code should 
look like a giant version of SplitAudio which meant I knew exactly where I had to go. I also 
got very lucky with searches on Stack Overflow when it came to functions to use to redirect 
standard input. However, one part that took some thought was how to account for a closing bracket
inside of a block inside of a comment which ended up taking me a lot more states that just covered
that one case which was frustrating. I also didn't realize that strcmp() returns false, not true
when two strings are equal which meant it took me a while to figure out why I couldn't check the 
arguments. But, using printf() whenever I had a bug or couldn't figure out where the code was going
wrong was extremely helpful. Overall, I quite enjoyed this project.
