----  -------  -----  --------------
10/27   1:30pm  2:00  read assignment and looked at Piazza for hints
                      struggled a lot to understand what the cooccurence matrix was actually doing
11/1  11:00am   1:30  started working on cooccur_create
11/2   2:00pm   5:00  kept working and got cooccur_create and update working
11/3   6:20am   6:00  finished read_context, vector, and destroy
11/6  11:00am   4:00  Cooccur main not working. Passes all the tests but valgrind is haywire
11/7   9:00am   3:00  Lots of error fixing in main. Went to office hours and finally solved it!
11/9  11:00am   5:00  trying to implement Aspnes' AVL code into gmap
11/10  7:00am   2:00  Finished!!

               28:00  TOTAL time spent

I discussed my solution with: Marley Hughes, Hamilton Wan, and Max Ranis about strategies of approach and how AVL trees work (complete with papers
full of diagrams :) )

Each one of these projects gets harder than the last! I had a lot of small errors again that just take years to fix. I did learn how to use gdb though
which was cool, but since most of my errors were valgrind issues, it wasn't all that helpful for this project. One of the biggest error I had that I 
couldn't figure out for the life of me was that I was adding a terminating character to my word buffer waaay after the actual end of the word. Luckily,
I jumped into the beginning of office hours and Blaize figured it out which was amazing. Implementing gmap as an AVL tree was a very challenging
problem since I was always really hesitant to change any of the code already there for fear of messing it up irreversibly. I also had a lot of issues
with calling functions before they were supposed to be called, so I was doing the right thing but they just came in slightly the wrong order. But,
it's done now and I'm so glad it's over! Theses projects though have been so good at helping learn way more about programming.
